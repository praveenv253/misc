Remapping keys in Ubuntu 14.04
------------------------------
*Specifically, remapping CapsLock to Control and PrintScreen to Menu*

I've made a couple of logs (on 16 Dec 2014) for the former. Read those first.

So now you know how to _use_ the existing xkb modifications in order to perform
some kinds of key-mappings. But for the case of PrintScreen to Menu, this is an
unorthodox remap, which is required only by Thinkpad users, so it doesn't exist
by default in any of the files in /usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols. Which means we'll
need to create our own!

So, based off of the "ctrl:nocaps" option, I wanted to create a new option for
"menu:noprsc". To do this, I first created a file called menu in
/usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols. That file has been replicated here.

But it turns out that this alone is not enough. In order to get xkb to
understand that you have created a new modification that you want to be able to
use via "setxkbmap -option", you need to define a new rule. Rules are defined
in /usr/share/X11/xkb/rules. I didn't know how to create a new rule so I
guessed. This involved grepping all files in the folder for the phrase
ctrl:nocaps, to see where and how it was defined. I found that the files
"base", "base.lst" and "base.xml" have definitions or descriptions of this
rule. There were also very similar definitions/descriptions in evdev*. So what
I did was to simply add my own rule, copying the general format. The modified
versions of these files have also been replicated here.

Changing base* also changes xfree86* and xorg*, since they are symlinked to
base*. I think this is an important part of making all this work, since I don't
know which of these - base, evdev, xfree86 or xorg are actually being made use
of here.

So after doing all this, you can go back to dconf-editor, and in org > gnome >
desktop > input-sources, you can add 'menu:noprsc' to xkb-options.

And that's it!

I just found a blog post by someone who seems to have gone through this exact
same process: https://realh.co.uk/wp/linux-keymap-hacking/
There's not a whole lot more information, though. Looks like everything just
has to be done by trial-and-error.

There is, however, this U&L answer which explains a lot more:

Also it seems that changing just evdev and evdev.xml under rules is sufficient.
There's no need to modify the base* files.

The above still works on Ubuntu 18.04 with Gnome. In fact, certain things
become simpler. Simply do the following:
1. Copy the menu file in this directory to /usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols
2. Then, edit evdev and evdev.xml in /usr/share/X11/xkb/rules, to include the
   lines corresponding to menu:noprsc
3. Open gnome-tweak-tool. Under Keyboard & Mouse -> Additional Layout Options,
   there should now be a new option called "Menu key position". Simply flick
   the switch
That's it!
